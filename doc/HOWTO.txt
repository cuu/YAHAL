1. How to create a new Code Composer Project and integrate the YAHAL library?
=============================================================================

The following steps are necessary to create a new project with YAHAL-support:

    - create a new CCS project as usual. Make sure you select the 'MSP 432 Family'
      and the MSP432P401R processor. Make also sure that you select a GNU C++
      compiler for the project (currently GNU v7.2.1 Linaro).
      
    - CCS itself does not support the creation of a C++ project, so after the
      step above some modifications have to be done manually:
      
           * Rename 'main.c' to 'main.cpp'
           
           * Pressing ALT+ENTER when the new project is selected, navigate to
             'Build->GNU Linker->Libraries'. Here you see a box where runtime
             libraries can be configured. The default are the 'gcc', 'nosys'
             and 'c' libraries. Edit the 'c' entry and rename it to 'c_nano'.
             Add a new library and call it 'supc++_nano'.
             
    - For the YAHAL support, press again ALT+ENTER on the selected project,
      and navigate to the 'Build' entry. On the right, you see a tab called
      'Dependencies'. Select this tab, and press the 'Add' button. Select the
      'YAHAL' entry in the list and press 'OK' (and 'OK' again :)
      
After that you can use all the YAHAL libraries in your project!

Some special hint when you use the multitasking kernel of YAHAL: When you see
strange (red) error messages like 'semihosting not supported', you can get rid
of these messages by right-klicking on the project and navigating to
'Debug As'->'Debug Configurations'. Select the 'Target' tab, and disable the
'Enable Semihosting' entry.
