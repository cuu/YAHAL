YAHAL can also be used on MacOS without the MCT VM.
The following steps have been tried out successfully on MacOS Darwin:

1.) Install CCS under MacOS (e.g. version 10.00)
2.) To work with git under CCS, the JRE in CCS
    has to be updated. For CCS 10.00, download
    jre-8u241-macosx-x64.tar.gz from the Oracle
    WEB site, and unpack the file unter
    /Applications/ti/ccs1000/ccs/Eclipse/Eclipse.app/jre
    There is also a documentation for this step
    in ILIAS.
3.) Clone the YAHAL repository (either in CCS or
    in a Terminal).
4.) Import the YAHAL project into the project explorer
5.) Under Properties->C/C++ Build->Environment
    change the PATH variable so that it contains an entry
    to the GNU arm compiler binary.
6.) Adapt the file makefiles/platform-msp432.mk so
    the entry CCS_ROOT points to your CCS installation
7.) In Proprties->C/C++ General->Indexer enable
    project specific settings and uncheck the box
    'Index source files not included in the build'
    
With these changes YAHAL should work fine with MacOS.
